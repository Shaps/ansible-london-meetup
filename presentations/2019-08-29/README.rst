              Many companies try to bridge the cultural/knowledge gap between development and operational 
              infrastructure teams. As most infrastructure providers today, are offering Ansible support 
              for their (HW or SW) based solutions, there is an opportunity to bridge that gap, using 
              common tools (Ansible) and processes (CI/CD pipelines). F5 Networks offers imperative and 
              declarative REST APIâ€™s in order to fit application delivery needs.
