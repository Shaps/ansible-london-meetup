              Many companies try to bridge the cultural/knowledge gap between development and operational 
              infrastructure teams. As most infrastructure providers today, are offering Ansible support 
              for their (HW or SW) based solutions, there is an opportunity to bridge that gap, using 
              common tools (Ansible) and processes (CI/CD pipelines). F5 Networks offers imperative and 
              declarative REST APIâ€™s in order to fit application delivery needs.

              Organisations that implement Positive Psychology have shown demonstrable improvements in levels of innovation and profitability
              alongside improved employee well-being. Recent studies have shown that technology workers are suffering a crisis in their 
              emotional and mental well-being, and this talk explores the topics of Positive Psychology and Authentic Happiness, and discusses
              how Ansible directly supports these.
